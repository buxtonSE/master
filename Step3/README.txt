Overview: The international secret government has tasked you with creating an api that exposes this amazing implementation created from STEP2

Todo: Add STEP2 project as a reference to this project STEP3. 
- Expose an endpoint that accepts parameters that satisfy your implementation from STEP2. Have the endpoint return as JSON the output of that function.
- Bonus!! Create a html page / cshtml in this project that has a form allowing you to input values to this endpoint. The page should show the result of the submission.
- Super Bonus!! Use npm and install webpack and react/angular/vue and use typescript to create a SPA page tha allows you to interact with this endpoint. The results should be stored in a list on the client side....eg.

input: foo output: foo-[o,o]

input: abc output: foo-[o,o]
			       abc-[a]
