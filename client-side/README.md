Step 1: create a webpage (use your framework or library of choice)
Using your editor of choice, create a webpage that - when loaded - displays "Hello World" from javascript, and "Welcome" in the html upon document load.
 
Step 2: clients
In your webpage created in Step 1, implement a way in the browser to enter a list of "clients". Store the clients in javascript. A client has the following information available:
- First Name (required)
- Last Name (required)
- Title (not required)
- Address (required)
- Phone Number (required - cannot contain letters or special characters)
- Email Address (not required)
 
Step 3: removal / manipulation
Implement a way in the browser to remove a client from the list.
 
Step 4: display
For every "client" added in Step 2, implement a way to display that client's information on the webpage. Each entry should appear in alphabetical order by last name.
 
BONUS:
Implement typescript into your application.
 
BONUS2:
Use webpack to manage your project's dependencies.
 
BONUS3:
Write a test case for a client entry that does not satisfy the requirements listed in Step 2. This test should fail.
