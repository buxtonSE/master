Overview: This is a top secret government project that allows any user to count all the vowels in a string. This is sector 7 classified and must be protected at all costs.

Todo: Create a method that lets you input a string then returns to you a string and returns to you an array of all the vowels in it [a,e,i,o,u]. If no vowels are returned then return an empty array / list. 
Allow the input to either come from console input or from a command line argument from the dotnet cli...eg.... dotnet run foobar --> [o,o,a]
