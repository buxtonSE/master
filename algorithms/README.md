Immplement to the best of your ability the below algorithms in any of the following languages (C#, javascript/typescript, Java, C++, C, Python)

1) Write a function that takes in as input a string and returns the number of unique letters. 
input: "foobar" --> 5 //f,o,b,a,r ... the o is there twice

2) Write a class / function that takes in as input a list of numbers and builds a binary search tree.
    - add a method to query this tree and output the result
    input: [5,7,9,20,30,60,15,3,8,5,1,12,13] --> query 3 returns "FOUND 3! 15 was my parent!! My parent has ### childen on the left"

3) Write a class / function that takes in as arguments 2 line segments. A line segment is a list of points in this case. This function should count the number of times these lines intersect.

input: segment 1: [(3,4), (5,6), (6,7)] segment 2: [(9,3), (6, 2)] output: some number >= 0
